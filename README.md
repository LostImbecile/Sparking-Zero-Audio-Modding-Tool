- Alternate Download: [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/18312)
## üöÄ Quick Instructions

1. Put your Game's Pak directory path in the config file.
2. Get your `.AWB` and `.uasset` files with [Fmodel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjCoHq5XxsIRARTcqUn12roO_SVsuiYhDwmwWXCrDQ0/edit?tab=t.pnuxbb3cbn2y#heading=h.qbnatqx0p168).
3. Drag any of the files into the tool. They can be located anywhere, but both files must be in the same folder.
4. **Identify the file to replace**:  
   Rename your `.wav` to match the original file name or name it "Cue_N" (N is its number)
5. Put the renamed `.wav` into the folder with the extracted HCAs.
6. Drag the folder into the tool and enter a name for the mod.

**That's it!** You can also see this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjCoHq5XxsIRARTcqUn12roO_SVsuiYhDwmwWXCrDQ0/edit?tab=t.qg24fpgvrtbx)

## üé∫BGM
Follow this [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjCoHq5XxsIRARTcqUn12roO_SVsuiYhDwmwWXCrDQ0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mdona1wxpcnp), [Spanish Translation By Ekonomia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyRd0iUqMNFcSFMW1cC1FB3ntIc9PmtWDeGvDbRIAGg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mdona1wxpcnp)
- You can replace all tracks in the game now  without the use of reloaded, and looping points can be set automatically without your interference, nor do you need to convert WAVs yourself
- You can port all of your HCAs used for reloaded directly, and you can do the rest following the guide (see [Porting From Reloaded](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjCoHq5XxsIRARTcqUn12roO_SVsuiYhDwmwWXCrDQ0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4le3ikxk076w))

## üìù Notes:
- **File-name sensitive**: Ensure all file names match.
- Keep the generated **`.hcakey`** in the folder‚Äîit‚Äôs needed to reconstruct the original key.
- Always retain the **Tools folder** in the directory.

## üìã Details

This tool handles all audio modding steps, including:
- Extracting `.awb` files if their corresponding `.uasset` or `.acb` files exist.
- Automatically converting all `.wav` files in the dropped folder to **HCA** format.
- Packaging folders back into `.awb` and injecting the new `.acb` into a `.uasset` file.
- Moving the packaged mod directly into your game's **mods folder**.
- Replaces BGM just like voices, and allows you to extract BGM files and listen to them directly

As for code, I didn't bother writing docs or comments for everything, nor did I structure it in a reasonable way (everything done in a hurry using tools when I could), sorry about that, modify the pak and utoc generators to use it with other games.

The vgmstream I use was forked and modified: https://github.com/Lostlmbecile/vgmstream-fork-dbsz
