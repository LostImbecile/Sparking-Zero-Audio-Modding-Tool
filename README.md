# Sparking Zero Audio Modding Tool

## 🚀 Quick Instructions

1. Put your Game's Pak directory path in the config file.
2. Get your `.AWB` and `.uasset` files.
3. Drag any of the files into the tool. They can be located anywhere, but both files must be in the same folder.
4. **Identify the file to replace**:  
   Use **foobar** or enable HCA conversion to find the file you want to replace.  
   Rename your `.wav` to match the original file name (note foobar starts from 1, HCAs start from 0).
5. Put the renamed `.wav` into the folder with the extracted HCAs.
6. Drag the folder into the tool and enter a name for the mod.

**That's it!**


### ⚠️ Disclaimer:
**Does not support BGM, se_battle, se_ui, & se_ADVIF!**


## 📋 Details

This tool handles all audio modding steps, including:
- Extracting `.awb` files if their corresponding `.uasset` or `.acb` files exist.
- Automatically converting all `.wav` files in the dropped folder to **HCA** format.
- Packaging folders back into `.awb` and injecting the new `.acb` into a `.uasset` file.
- Moving the packaged mod directly into your game's **mods folder**.

Contact `lostimbecile` on Discord for any issues.

As for code, I didn't bother writing docs or comments for everything, sorry about that, modify the pak and utoc generators to use it with other games.

## 🔄 Process

### Extraction:
1. **Drag & Drop** any `.acb`, `.uasset`, or `.awb` files into the tool.
2. The tool **checks for matching pairs** and **extracts `.acb` from `.uasset`** if needed.
3. Duplicate pairs are **filtered automatically**, so no manual selection is required.

### Packaging & Conversion:
1. Locate the **HCA** you want to replace and put your renamed `.wav` into the corresponding folder.
2. **Drag & Drop** all folders you want to repackage into `.awb`.
3. Provide a name for your mod when prompted.
4. The tool:
   - Converts all `.wav` files in the folders to **HCA** and replaces old files.
   - Checks if the `.acb` or `.uasset` exists and extracts `.acb` if needed.
   - Packages the folder into `.awb` and **creates a backup** of the `.uasset` file.
   - Injects the new `.acb` into the `.uasset` file.
   - Uses **UnrealPak** and **UnrealReZen** to pack the files into the mods folder.


### 📝 Notes:
- **File-name sensitive**: Ensure all file names match.
- Keep the generated **`.hcakey`** in the folder—it’s needed to reconstruct the original key.
- Always retain the **Tools folder** and **`keys.csv`** in the directory.


## 💡 Example:

1. **Drop `BTCLV_0000_00_JP.uasset`** into the tool:
   - The tool checks if matching `.awb` and `.acb` files exist.
   - If `.acb` is missing, it extracts it from the `.uasset` file.
   - The tool extracts `.awb` and stores its **`.hcakey`** in a folder named `BTCLV_0000_00_JP`.

2. Put `00121_streaming.wav` into the generated folder.

3. Drag the folder into the tool.
   - The tool converts the `.wav` into **HCA** using the reconstructed key and replaces the old file.
   - The tool then packages the folder into `.awb` and injects the new `.acb` into the `.uasset` file.

4. Input a name for your mod.
   - The tool uses **UnrealPak** and **UnrealReZen** to finalise the mod and place it in the **mods folder**.
